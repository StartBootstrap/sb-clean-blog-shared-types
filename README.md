# INIP SB Clean Blog Shared Types

Shared types for sb-clean-blog-node and sb-clean-blog-angular

## Development

```bash
cd PATH/TO/sb-clean-blog-shared-types
npm link

cd PATH/TO/sb-clean-blog-node
npm link @start-bootstrap/sb-clean-blog-shared-types
cd PATH/TO/sb-clean-blog-angular
npm link @start-bootstrap/sb-clean-blog-shared-types
```

_NOTE: Due to an issue with npm, any time you do an npm install in either the angular or node projects, you will need to redo the npm link command again._
